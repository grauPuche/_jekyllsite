# _jekyllsite

## goal

__To learn to use jekyll at while getting used to github.__

To be more specific, I'm trying to redo my website with jekyll. The issue here is that I have to create my own template, due to me being a graphic design grad that does not want to change the look of his website. the reason of using jekyll is that I need a better way of updating the content in my porfolio and a quick way to do my blogpost while I'm a graduate student at ITP.

_as a Bonus there's the fact of getting used to __*md*__ _writing, which I have never done til today_ 


## process

The first thing has to be getting used to new workflow and software, this is being done with __Code Visual Studio__. I'm using it due to its capavilities as a debugger and connection to gitHub.
