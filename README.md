# DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THIS (WIP)

## goal

__To learn to use jekyll while getting used to github.__

To be more specific, I'm trying to redo my website with jekyll. The issue here is that I have to create my own template, due to me being a graphic design grad that does not want to change the look of his website. the reason of using jekyll is that I need a better way of updating the content in my porfolio and a quick way to do my blogpost while I'm a graduate student at ITP.

_As a Bonus there's the fact of getting used to **md** writing, which I have never done 'til today_ 


## process

The first thing has to be getting used to new workflow and software, this is being done with **Code Visual Studio**. I'm using it due to its capavilities as a debugger and connection to gitHub.

### set-up

I need to understand Jekyll and how it works, I also need/want to set it in a VPS as it is part of my one of my classes.

Said VPS is partialy already set up, it has configurations for a _Basic Server_ using _node.js_ and a _Express Server_. to set up the server using _Jekyll_ I'm using the guide done by [Tristan Dunn](https://github.com/tristandunn/jekyll-vps-server/tree/master),
